# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School.  
It introduces two important data structures in Python: **lists** and **tuples**.  
You will learn how to manipulate them efficiently and understand when and why to use each.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

- What are lists and how to use them
- The differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- The `del` statement and how to use it

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- All code is written in Python and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- No imports of modules unless specified
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files are executable
- Each Python file starts with `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Project Structure

Each task corresponds to a Python file:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0-print_list_integer.py | Prints all integers of a list using `str.format()` |
| 1-element_at.py | Retrieves an element from a list at a given index |
| 2-replace_in_list.py | Replaces an element at a specific index |
| 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py | Prints a list in reverse order |
| 4-new_in_list.py | Creates a copy of a list with a modified element |
| 5-no_c.py | Removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string |
| 6-print_matrix_integer.py | Prints a matrix of integers |
| 7-add_tuple.py | Adds two tuples element-wise |
| 8-multiple_returns.py | Returns the length of a string and its first character |
| 9-max_integer.py | Finds the biggest integer in a list |
| 10-divisible_by_2.py | Finds all multiples of 2 in a list |
| 11-delete_at.py | Deletes an item at a specific index in a list |
| 12-switch.py | Switches values of variables `a` and `b` |

## Usage

To run any of the files:

```bash
./<filename>.py
