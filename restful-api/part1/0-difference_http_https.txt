HTTP vs HTTPS

1. Security:
   - HTTP: No encryption. Data is visible during transmission.
   - HTTPS: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS, protecting it from interception and tampering.

2. Port:
   - HTTP uses port 80.
   - HTTPS uses port 443.

3. URL Scheme:
   - HTTP: http://example.com
   - HTTPS: https://example.com

4. Certificates:
   - HTTP does not require any certificate.
   - HTTPS requires an SSL/TLS certificate issued by a Certificate Authority.

5. Use Cases:
   - HTTP: Static websites or non-sensitive content.
   - HTTPS: Login forms, payment systems, and any site handling user data.
